This project contains code to setting up the PN532 NFC card reader as well as the GT-511C3 fingerprint scanner to work with logging into an application.
The code for enrolling a fingerprint is not included in this, as the example code can be found along within the GT-511C3 fingerprint library. 
For a full step by step basis on how the whole setup works, visit the link above.

Thanks to The Electrodog Show at instructables for setting up the basic code for the NFC card reader, you can view his profile here: http://www.instructables.com/member/The%20Electrodog%20Show/
